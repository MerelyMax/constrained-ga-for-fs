# Feature selection using constrained genetic algorithm
**Important note: this project was build for study purposes.**

**constrained-ga-for-fs** is a Python module for automated "wrapper" feature selection. The algorithm "wraps" subset of features around a specific model (the model can be chosen by the user) and uses prediction accuracy of this subset as a criterion wether to select these features or not.
